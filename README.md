### github-task-sync

Synchronise task lists with GitHub Projects using the gh CLI. Use this skill when users want to add tasks, to-dos, or action items to a GitHub repository's project board. The skill can extract tasks from markdown files, user messages, or structured data, then create GitHub issues and add them to projects. It intelligently detects the target repository from git remotes when not explicitly specified.
